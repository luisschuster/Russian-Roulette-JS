# Russian-Roulette-JS
This is a very simple russian roulette game, that can be played in the browser. It uses JavaScript to generate a random number and then determines wether you lose or win by checking if the number is greater than or equal to the value entered by the user. 
A live demo is available [on my website](https://luisschuster.dev/russian_roulette/).
